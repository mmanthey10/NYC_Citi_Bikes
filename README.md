# NYC Citi Bike Trips Analysis 

## Purpose/Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gain useful insight into the behavior of riders and the trends within usage. This insight can provide insight into items such as 1) when and which bikes require maintenance 2) what time periods throughout the day require the most available bikes 3) does usage by user type or gender factor play a role in demand and if so, how can this information benefit strategy?, among others.

## Results & Summary

* Peak rides appear to be drive by the morning commuting population.
* Usage is largely driven by males.
* Bike Trips by weekday has two interesting stories to tell. First, it supports the theory that the morning commuters drive weekday usage. Midday weekend usage outpaces that of midday weekend usage, supported leisure/non-work related usage on weekends.
